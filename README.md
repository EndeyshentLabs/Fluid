# Fluid

Fluid is a build system for projects made with LOVE2D(Lua programming language) framework.

## Initializing a project

```console
$ fluid-init
[NOTE] THIS IS NOT FINAL PRODUCT. EVERYTHING MAY BE CHANGED.
Name of the project: <stdin> CoolProj
Build directory: <stdin> Build
---------------
Name: CoolProj
Build directory: Build
Is this configuration is suitable to you? (Y/n) <stdin> Y
... WGET STUFF ...
[NOTE] Do not forget to add your project files into config.fluid!
```

NOTE: project reinitialization will overwrite the existing config.fluid!

## Building

If you have already initialized a project:

```console
$ ./fluid
```

## Cleaning

```console
$ ./fluid clean
```
